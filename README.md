# DelayAwareDDQL
Delay Aware DDQL algorithm for access control in LTE-A

 RUN BASE_FILE

THIS FILE RUNS THE EXPERIMENTS FOR TRAINING AND CALLS THE SIMULATOR CALLED
LTEA_M_H_ACB_DDQL_TRAO…..m

THE FILE calculaterewardexample.m is the cost function. This can be modified

THE FILE convierteaccionavars.m is just a function called by LTE_M…m


The original LTE simulator was implemented by Luis Tello https://github.com/lptelloq/LTE-A_RACHprocedure

This file is an implementation of Double Deep Q-Learning for access control optimization in a system that can adapt both Pacb and Trao
